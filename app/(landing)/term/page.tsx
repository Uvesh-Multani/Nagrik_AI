              These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us
              on the Services or in respect to the Services constitute the
              entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure
              to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Legal Terms
              shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These
              Legal Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We
              may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at
              any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss,
              damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our
              reasonable control. If any provision or part of a provision of
              these Legal Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or
              unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed
              severable from these Legal Terms and does not affect the validity
              and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint
              venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship created
              between you and us as a result of these Legal Terms or use of the
              Services. You agree that these Legal Terms will not be construed
              against us by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby waive any
              and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of
              these Legal Terms and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to
              execute these Legal Terms.
